## Introduction

Since moving down to Sarasota, FL in November of 2023, I have am now experiencing my second summer here. It has taught me a lot, mostly how much your lifestyle can change depending on your location in this world.

On top of that, I have changed so much of what I do on a day-to-day basis. In college, for instance, I would often come home from school (or skip school altogether) and play videogames or partake in many of the unhealthy activities many college students do. I had no real sense of time or my schedule for the day. I was just going by on the edge of my chair for whatever interested me. That approach got me into **a lot** of trouble.

Fast forward a few years, I am now 26 years old, working full-time and outside of going to the gym, I have ditched many of the habits I frequented back then. Not only that, but I made flip of my wake/sleep habits. Back then, I would frequently stay up into the wee hours of the night and sometimes the morning, and not waking until 10, 11, even past noon some days. Now, I do my best to get up every day (even on weekends) around 5am. With this approach, I start my day with my workout (either resistance training or cardio) and get it done before I make excuses later in the day. This is one example of the many habit changes I have made since college. The list goes on and on.

## Need for Adventure

While this lifestyle change has benefitted me in many aspects of life, one thing I do miss from that time period was the adventure and adrenaline I was constantly living with in my daily life. Now that I work an entry-level full-time job 9-5 M-F, I have little time to get adventurous. Weekends are thoughtfully planned out weeks ahead in order to make the most of my free time. For some reason, my brain has been hungry for a reconnection with nature. Although I have gone on some fun trips into nature, I have yet to fully immerse myself in it. So I am seeking your advice, what should I do? Where should I go to fufill that desire? Let me know your thoughts [alex@hauschelmedia.com](mailto:alex@hauschelmedia.com).

### Plan A: Camping in the Keys

Ideally, I would like to take a trip down to Key West and camp along the State Parks until we reach there. I have been researching the following locations:
